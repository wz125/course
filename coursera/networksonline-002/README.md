The course is based on a graduate course that I have taught at Stanford for several years, and so it does require some mathematical background: familiarity with matrices, derivatives, and the basics of probability and statistics will be assumed at various points in the course. However, the course should still be accessible at a variety of levels and you are welcome to take the course at your own speed: you can just follow the basic lectures and quizzes (ungraded), you can also complete (graded) problem sets and exam. In addition there are some optional lectures, as well as some optional (ungraded) advanced problem sets for those who want to dig more deeply into the details of applications and theoretical foundations of some of the models. 
The course is self-contained, but you can find added detail via the many references that are included in the slides (see the end of each week's posted slides) also via some of the resources linked to from my web site http://www.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/ .
