+ **Q**(He apologized, `so` you should forgive him.） **conclusion marker**(The word “so” indicates that the sentence following “so” is a conclusion. Thus, this sentence means that “you should forgive him” is a conclusion supported by the premise “he apologized.” This function of the word “so” is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “therefore” for “so”: He apologized. Therefore, you should forgive him.）
+ **Q**(`In view of the fact` that he apologized, you should forgive him.)  **premise marker**（The phrase “In view of the fact that” indicates that the sentence immediately following that phrase is a premise. Thus, this sentence means that the fact that he apologized is a reason for the conclusion that you should forgive him. This function of the phrase is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “because” for “In view of the fact that”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him.）
+ **Q**(He apologized. `Accordingly`, you should forgive him.) **conclusion marker**(The word “accordingly” indicates that the sentence following that phrase is a conclusion. Thus, this sentence means that “you should forgive him” is a conclusion supported by the premise “he apologized.” This function of the word is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “therefore” for “accordingly”: He apologized. Therefore, you should forgive him.)
+ **Q**(`After` he apologizes, you should forgive him.) **neither**(The word “after” indicates only a temporal relation, not a relation of reason or premise to conclusion. Thus, the meaning does change if we substitute “because” (or “therefore”) for “after”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him. Notice that this sentence might suggest (or conversationally imply) that his apology is a reason to forgive him, but the sentence does not make that claim explicitly, so “after” is neither a reason marker nor a conclusion marker.)
+ **Q**(`Seeing as` he apologized, you should forgive him.) **premise marker**(The phrase “Seeing as” indicates that the sentence immediately following that phrase is a premise. Thus, this sentence means that the fact that he apologized is a reason for the conclusion that you should forgive him. This function of the phrase is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “because” for “Seeing as”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him.)

#3 - 3 - Lecture 2-3 - A Problem For Arguments (12-54)
## Outline
**the problem of the skeptical regress:**

    1. start with a premisethat's unjustified.
    2. use a structure where the arguments move in a circle.
    3. the chain of arguments goes back infinitely.

**tricks for dealing with the skeptical regress:**

    1. Assure the audience
    2. Discount the objections
    3. Guard you claim

+ **Q**(Ram asks Walter which team will win the basketball tournament, and Walter says, “Duke, and I can prove it: Duke will score more points than all of its opponents, so Duke will win.” Then Ram asks, “But how do you know that Duke will score more points than its opponents?” Walter answers, “I don’t know. I just hope so.) **The premise is unjustified.**(The premise (“Duke will score more points than all of its opponents”) is unjustified if Walter is just hoping (or guessing), as he admits. He has no reason to believe that it is true. If we were allowed to use premises that are unjustified like this, then we could use them to prove anything, including absurdities. That is why such unjustified premises are not allowed.)
+ **Q**(Ram asks Walter which team will win the basketball tournament, and Walter says, “Duke, and I can prove it: Duke is going to win, so Duke will win. Now, prove that I am wrong!”) **The argument is circular.**(The premise (“Duke is going to win”) is equivalent to the conclusion (“Duke will win”). That makes the argument circular in the sense that it ends up where it started. It does not get anywhere. Circular arguments like this are illegitimate, because, if they worked, then they could be used to prove anything, including the opposite conclusion (as in “Duke is going to lose, so Duke will lose”). That shows why such circular arguments are objectionable.)
