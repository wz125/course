+ **Q**(He apologized, `so` you should forgive him.） **conclusion marker**(The word “so” indicates that the sentence following “so” is a conclusion. Thus, this sentence means that “you should forgive him” is a conclusion supported by the premise “he apologized.” This function of the word “so” is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “therefore” for “so”: He apologized. Therefore, you should forgive him.）
+ **Q**(`In view of the fact` that he apologized, you should forgive him.)  **premise marker**（The phrase “In view of the fact that” indicates that the sentence immediately following that phrase is a premise. Thus, this sentence means that the fact that he apologized is a reason for the conclusion that you should forgive him. This function of the phrase is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “because” for “In view of the fact that”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him.）
+ **Q**(He apologized. `Accordingly`, you should forgive him.) **conclusion marker**(The word “accordingly” indicates that the sentence following that phrase is a conclusion. Thus, this sentence means that “you should forgive him” is a conclusion supported by the premise “he apologized.” This function of the word is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “therefore” for “accordingly”: He apologized. Therefore, you should forgive him.)
+ **Q**(`After` he apologizes, you should forgive him.) **neither**(The word “after” indicates only a temporal relation, not a relation of reason or premise to conclusion. Thus, the meaning does change if we substitute “because” (or “therefore”) for “after”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him. Notice that this sentence might suggest (or conversationally imply) that his apology is a reason to forgive him, but the sentence does not make that claim explicitly, so “after” is neither a reason marker nor a conclusion marker.)
+ **Q**(`Seeing as` he apologized, you should forgive him.) **premise marker**(The phrase “Seeing as” indicates that the sentence immediately following that phrase is a premise. Thus, this sentence means that the fact that he apologized is a reason for the conclusion that you should forgive him. This function of the phrase is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we substitute “because” for “Seeing as”: Because he apologized, you should forgive him.)

#3 - 3 - Lecture 2-3 - A Problem For Arguments (12-54)
## Outline
**the problem of the skeptical regress:**

    1. start with a premisethat's unjustified.
    2. use a structure where the arguments move in a circle.
    3. the chain of arguments goes back infinitely.

+ **Q**(Ram asks Walter which team will win the basketball tournament, and Walter says, “Duke, and I can prove it: Duke will score more points than all of its opponents, so Duke will win.” Then Ram asks, “But how do you know that Duke will score more points than its opponents?” Walter answers, “I don’t know. I just hope so.) **The premise is unjustified.**(The premise (“Duke will score more points than all of its opponents”) is unjustified if Walter is just hoping (or guessing), as he admits. He has no reason to believe that it is true. If we were allowed to use premises that are unjustified like this, then we could use them to prove anything, including absurdities. That is why such unjustified premises are not allowed.)
+ **Q**(Ram asks Walter which team will win the basketball tournament, and Walter says, “Duke, and I can prove it: Duke is going to win, so Duke will win. Now, prove that I am wrong!”) **The argument is circular.**(The premise (“Duke is going to win”) is equivalent to the conclusion (“Duke will win”). That makes the argument circular in the sense that it ends up where it started. It does not get anywhere. Circular arguments like this are illegitimate, because, if they worked, then they could be used to prove anything, including the opposite conclusion (as in “Duke is going to lose, so Duke will lose”). That shows why such circular arguments are objectionable.)

#3 - 4 - Lecture 2-4 - Assuring (14:15)
## Outline
    argumentative moves`三种常见的论述方式` (Asuring Guarding Discounting`消弱`)
    the evidence has not actually been cited(观点实际还没有被引用！)
    types of assurances(Authoritative Rflexive Abusive) 确信的类型

**通过这三种方式终止疑问回溯**

**tricks of with assurances:**  
1. Citations of untrustworthy authorities  
2. Distractions  
3. Dropping assurances  
**Assurances are not appropriate when**  
1. No one would question the claim anyway  
2. The authority is not trustworthy
3.

+ **Q**(I assure you that you can trust my sister.) **Assuring term**(The phrase “I assure you” is clearly intended to assure you that you can trust my sister, so it functions an assuring term.)
+ **Q**(You certainly can trust my sister.) **Assuring term**(The term “certainly” here means that it is certain (or you can be certain) that you can trust my sister. This assures you. This function is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change significantly if you replace “certainly” with “assuredly” to get “You assuredly can trust my sister.” Notice also that it would be odd to add “… but I am not sure” at the end to get this oxymoron: You certainly can trust my sister, but I am not sure that you can trust her.)
+ **Q**( know that you can trust my sister.) **Assuring term**(The phrase “I know that … ” here implies that the following claim is true and justified or reliable. The force of this utterance does not change significantly if you replace “I know that … ” with “I am sure that …” to get “I am sure that you can trust my sister.” Notice also that it would be odd to add “… but I am not sure” at the end to get this oxymoron: I know that can trust my sister, but I am not sure that you can trust her.)
+ **Q**(Only an idiot would deny that you can trust my sister.) **Assuring term**(This example is abusive assuring. It tries to make you feel assured by abusing the very idea of questioning what I claim, which is that you can trust my sister.)
+ **Q**(Imagine that you want to go to a soccer game tonight, so you ask me whether the local team is playing a home game tonight. I respond, “I believe that they are playing a home game tonight.”`试想一下，你今晚想要去足球比赛，所以你问我当地的球队是打一个主场比赛今晚。我回答：“我相信，他们今晚是一个主场比赛。”`) **Not assuring term**(If I knew, then I would say simply that they are playing a home game tonight. Thus, the fact that I add the qualification “I believe that ...” suggests uncertainty, so it does not assure you that I am right. This role is shown by the naturalness of adding “… but I am not sure” at the end to get this: "I believe that they are playing a home game tonight, but I am not sure.")

#3 - 5 - Lecture 2-5 - Guarding (8:01)
## Outline
    guarding involves making your premises weaker so that it is other to object to them.`让步通常使你的立场较弱，并难以反驳！`
    three ways(Extent`范围` Probability`可能性` Mental`心理`)
## note
    可以通过把论点变得越来越弱的方式，使对方难以反驳，这是一种停止无休止争论的途径。
## example
    我们不要 A，因为他会导致 B；Guarding(我认为我们不要一些Ａ，因为他会导致Ｂ)

+ **Q**`范围`(If someone says, “Almost everyone agrees with me,” is the particular term “almost” being used as a guarding term or as an assuring term in this context?) **Guarding term**(Almost everyone agrees” is harder to refute than the unqualified “Everyone agrees”, so the term “almost” is added in order to make the claim harder to refute. The claim cannot be refuted, for example, simply by pointing out one person who disagrees. Notice that the whole phrase “Almost everyone agrees with me” is used for assuring, but the single word “almost” can still be used for guarding within the larger assuring phrase.)
+ **Q**`可能性`(If someone was going to say that an event is “very likely” but instead they say only that it is “likely”, then is the phrase “likely” being used as a guarding term?) **Guarding term**(By dropping the term “very” this speaker guards his claim by making it harder to refute. Sometimes the term “likely” is not used for guarding, but here it is, because the relevant alternative is “very likely”, and that expected alternative is easier to refute.)
+ **Q**(Some people have raised questions about her program, so we should oppose it.) **Guarding term**(By saying that some people have raised questions instead of saying that everyone finds the program questionable, the speaker weakens this claim so that it is easier to defend. That is what guarding does. Notice that, even if some people (say, 1%) have raised questions, there still might be a lot more people (99%!) who do not find her program questionable at all.)
+ **Q**(Many people agree that her program won’t work, so we should oppose it.) **Guarding term**(By saying that many people agree instead of saying that all people agree, the speaker weakens this claim so that it is easier to defend. That is what guarding does. Notice that, even if many people agree that her program won’t work, there still might be many—even more—other people who disagree and think that her program will work.)
+ **Q**(Her program will lead to many problems, so we should oppose it.) **Not Guarding term**(No reasonable person would think that her program will lead to all problems—that is, to every problem in the world—so it makes no sense to understand this premise that her program will lead to many problems as a weakened version of the claim that it will lead to all problems. Thus, this use of the term “many” does not function as a guarding term. This example shows that we cannot identify guarding in a purely mechanical way simple by looking for certain words. Instead, we need to think about how the term functions in the argument.)

#3 - 6 - Lecture 2-6 - Discounting消弱 (10:20)
## Outline
    discounting is citing a possible criticism in order to reject it or counter it `事先列举可能存在的争议，来截断异议`
**functions of discounting terms:**  

+ They assert two  claims.  
+ They contrast the two claims.  
+ They emphazise one of the clainms.  

** the trick of discounting straw people `消弱的窍门在于`** 

+ the arguer discounts easy objections to make people overlook the more difficult objections. 
`消弱容易的反对意见，使人们忽略了更难得反对意见！`
+ arguers can combine the trick the discounting straw people with misuses of guarding assuring.
`通过保证和消弱的使用，可以使争论者掉进预先设定的陷阱，而不是按照他们方式进行`

**that is trick that you have to  learn to watch  out for .**

+ **Q**(Although it is raining, I am going for a walk anyway.) **Discounting term**(If the speaker merely said, “I am going for a walk,” then the audience might object, “You should not go for a walk now because it is raining.” The initial clause “although it is raining” shows that the speaker is aware of the rain and recognizes it as a possible objection to going for a walk. Thus, the speaker heads off that potential objection. That is what discounting does: it avoids or responds to objections.Notice that, if the speaker had instead said, “It is raining and I am going for a walk,” this new utterance would not indicate any awareness that rain is a reason not to go for a walk, so this new utterance would not discount that objection. This comparison shows that the word “although” functions as a discounting term in a way that the word “and” does not.)
+ **Q**(It is raining. Still, I am going for a walk.) **Discounting term**(The word “still” shows that the speaker recognizes the rain as a possible objection to going for a walk. The clause with “still” discounts that potential objection. This function is shown by the fact that the meaning does not change if we replace “still” with “however” (as in “However, I am going for a walk”).The comparison between this example and the previous two shows that the discounting term can be located either before the objection that is discounted (as in “although it is raining” and “even if it is raining”) or before the clause that the objection objects to (as in “Still, I am going for a walk anyway”) or in the middle of that clause (as in “I am still going for a walk”).)
