## Execise
+ **Q**(A verb fails the thereby test if there is any case in any circumstance where I say ‘I _____’ but I do not thereby _____.) **F**(I can say “I promise to meet you” in some unusual and inappropriate circumstances without thereby promising to meet you. For example, if an actor during a play says, “I promise to meet you,” then that actor does not really promise to meet you. He is just repeating lines in a play, not really promising. However, these abnormal cases do NOT show that the verb “promise” does not pass the thereby test or that promising is not a speech act, because the complete thereby test includes a crucial qualification: If I say ___while IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES, then I thereby ___. Because of the qualification “in appropriate circumstances”, utterances that are not in appropriate circumstances do not show that a verb fails the thereby test. Thus, the sentence in this question is false, because it refers to “any case in any circumstances” without limiting the circumstances to appropriate circumstances. This was also the point of the arbitrary marriage pronouncement in the lecture. Saying "I now pronounce you husband and wife" performs the speech act of pronouncing them husband and wife (and also has the effect of making them married) when these words are uttered in appropriate circumstances, so this kind of utterance DOES pass the thereby test. However, an utterance of these words performs the speech act of pronouncing them husband and wife ONLY in appropriate circumstances. Uttering the same words does NOT make people married or even perform the speech act of officially pronouncing them husband and wife when these words are uttered in inappropriate circumstances, such as to a random couple on the street. Still, that random marriage case does NOT show that pronouncing fails the thereby test, because that case occurs in inappropriate circumstances. This shows, again, that the sentence in this question is false, because it refers to “any case in any circumstances” without limiting the circumstances to appropriate circumstances.)
+ **Q**(Whenever a verb passes the thereby test (that is, whenever the verb fits into the blank in If I say I _____in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby _____), the verb names a speech act.) **T**(This is the point of the thereby test.)
+ **Q**(Concluding is a speech act.) **T**(If I say ‘I conclude that Pluto is not a planet’ in appropriate circumstance (including the presence of premises and perhaps authority), then I thereby conclude that Pluto is not a planet. Thus, “conclude” passes the thereby test, so this verb names a speech act.)
+ **Q**(When I say, “I ordered you to leave” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby ordered you to leave.
) **F**(When I say, “I ordered you to leave”, I am referring to the past rather than the present. Imagine that on Monday I order you to leave, and then on Tuesday I say, “I ordered you to leave.” What I say on Tuesday is true, but I do not thereby order you, since the word “thereby” in this context claims that I order you at the time in the very act of saying that I order you.)
+  **Q** (When I say, “My sister orders you to leave” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby order you to leave.) **T**(This sentence is referring to what my sister does rather than to what I do. I am reporting or describing the order that SHE issued rather than issuing any order of MY OWN. Hence, I do not order you THEREBY—that is, in the very act of uttering these words. Moreover, the order that SHE gives is not accomplished in MY act of uttering these words. Thus, this is also false: When I say, “My sister orders you to leave” in appropriate circumstances, then my sister thereby orders you to leave. She does not order you to leave in (or by means of) my act of saying that she orders you to leave. Her utterance and my utterance accomplish separate speech acts.)
+ **Q**(When I say, “I am sorry for hurting you” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby am sorry for hurting you.
) **F**(This sentence describes how I feel, but that feeling does not occur in the very act of uttering these words, since I could feel sorry without uttering the words, and I could utter the words without really feeling sorry. The sentence does perform the speech act of apologizing, but feeling sorry is not a speech act.)
+ ** Q**(When I say, “I convince you to keep trying” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby convince you to keep trying.
) ** F**(Convincing requires an effect in the audience (here that the audience does keep trying). That effect occurs at a later time after the speech act, so this effect does not occur in the very act of saying “I convince you to keep trying.”)
+ **Q**(When I say, “I warn you of the danger” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby warn you of the danger.
) **T**(Warning is a speech act.)
+ **Q**(When I say, “I make you aware of the danger” in appropriate circumstances, then I thereby make you aware of the danger.
) **F**(Making you aware requires an effect in the audience (that the audience does become aware). That effect occurs at a later time after the speech act, so this effect does not occur in the very act of saying “I make you aware of the danger.”)

*KEY WORDS(cooperating with each other):*

	3. **Relevance:Be relevant.**

## Execise
+ **Q**(Verbs that name conversational acts pass the thereby test.) **F**(A conversational act requires an effect that occurs at a later time after the utterance, so this effect does not occur during or in the very act of speaking. Hence, the speech does not thereby (in itself) perform the conversational act. That is why conversational acts fail the thereby test.)
+ **Q**(Informing is a conversational act.) **T**(Informing refers to making the audience informed or aware of certain information, which is an effect of the utterance.)
